# üõí Supermart Management System

## üìå Overview
The **Supermart Management System** is a desktop-based retail application built using **C++/CLI** and the **.NET Framework**, designed to simulate an shopping experience. It supports customer registration, product browsing, cart management, billing, and administrative control ‚Äî all within a modular, multi-class architecture.

This project demonstrates your ability to build structured, real-world systems with GUI, file-based persistence, and clean separation of concerns.

|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Product`    | Represents individual items with name, weight, price, quantity, and ID |
| `Person`     | Base class for shared identity (`Name`)                                |
| `Cust`       | Inherits `Person`, adds phone and cart functionality                   |
| `Customer`   | Lightweight customer info container                                    |
| `admin`      | Stores admin credentials and access methods                            |
| `billing`    | Calculates total, applies discounts, generates bill                    |
| `DatabaseOperations` | Handles file I/O: insert, read, search, update, delete         |
| `mapper`     | Converts file data into object arrays (`Product`, `Cust`)              |
| `MyForm`     | Contains all event-driven logic for UI interaction                     |

## üß™ How It Works

### üõçÔ∏è Customer Flow
1. **Login/Register**  
2. **Browse Products**  
3. **Add to Cart**  
4. **Update/Delete Cart Items**  
5. **Proceed to Billing**  
6. **View Bill & Refund**

### üõ°Ô∏è Admin Flow
1. **Login with credentials**  
2. **Manage Products**  
   - Add new items  
   - Update quantity  
   - Delete or search items  
3. **View Customer Inventory**

### üí≥ Billing Logic
- If bill ‚â§ 5000 ‚Üí No discount  
- If bill > 5000 ‚Üí 10% discount applied  
- Refund calculated based on payment input  
- Bill displayed with itemized breakdown and total

## ü™û Developer Reflection

This project marks a major milestone in my journey from basic experimentation to building structured, multi-class desktop applications.

### What I Learned
- Designing reusable classes with inheritance (`Person ‚Üí Customer/Admin`)  
- Structuring logic across multiple header/source files  
- Managing state and UI flow with Windows Forms  
- Abstracting file I/O with `DB` and `mapper` classes  
- Implementing real-time cart and billing logic

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring consistent data mapping between files and objects  
- Handling edge cases in billing and cart operations  
- Synchronizing UI events with backend logic

### Solutions Implemented
- Created a `mapper` class to handle file parsing and object conversion  
- Used encapsulation to isolate billing logic  
- Modularized UI and logic for easier debugging and maintenance

### Portfolio Value
This system reflects my ability to build structured, real-world applications with clean architecture and user-friendly interfaces. It demonstrates my growth in both technical depth and design thinking.
